We love your input! We want to make contributing to REST-SPEC as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥22.11.0 (LTS)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/REST-SPEC.git
   cd REST-SPEC
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks**

   ```bash
   npm run prepare
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**

   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   ```

```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style:

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Line Length**: 100 characters max
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for JavaScript, double quotes for JSON
- **Semicolons**: Required
- **Trailing Commas**: Required for multiline structures

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (`getUserData`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`ConfigManager`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (`user-service.js`)
- **Directories**: kebab-case (`user-management`)

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples

```text
feat: add dry-run mode to CLI commands

fix(security): sanitize user input in project names

docs: update API documentation for new endpoints

test: add unit tests for input sanitizer

chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

## Testing

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

### Writing Tests

- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Follow the naming pattern: `*.test.js`
- Aim for at least 70% code coverage
- Write descriptive test names

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/unit/config-loader.test.js

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- Include parameter types and return types
- Provide examples for complex functions

```javascript
/**
 * Sanitizes a project name to prevent security vulnerabilities
 * @param {string} projectName - The project name to sanitize
 * @param {Object} options - Configuration options
 * @param {boolean} options.allowSpaces - Whether to allow spaces
 * @returns {string} The sanitized project name
 * @throws {Error} If project name is invalid
 * @example
 * const clean = sanitizeProjectName('my-project');
 */
function sanitizeProjectName(projectName, options = {}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### README Updates

When adding new features, update the relevant documentation:

- Main README.md for user-facing changes
- Technical documentation for internal changes
- CLI documentation for new commands or options

## Security

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate all user inputs
- Use the provided security utilities in `/shared/`
- Follow the security checklist in `docs/security-checklist.md`

### Reporting Security Issues

Please report security vulnerabilities to <security@rest-spec.org>. Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Performance

### Performance Considerations

- Prefer asynchronous operations for I/O
- Use streaming for large file operations
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Minimize dependencies

### Benchmarking

When making performance changes:

1. Create benchmarks for the affected code
2. Measure before and after performance
3. Include benchmark results in your PR

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure any new features are documented
2. **Add Tests**: Write tests for your changes
3. **Run the Full Test Suite**: `npm test && npm run lint && npm run typecheck`
4. **Check Security**: Run `npm audit` and fix any issues
5. **Update CHANGELOG**: Add your changes to the changelog (if applicable)
