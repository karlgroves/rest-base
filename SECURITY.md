## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches
depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The REST-SPEC team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Where to Report

To report a security issue, please email [security@rest-spec.org](mailto:security@rest-spec.org) with:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Possible impacts
4. Any suggested remediation

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, you can expect:

1. **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
2. **Detailed Response**: Within 1 week with our assessment
3. **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### Coordinated Disclosure

We ask that you:

* Give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue before making any information public
* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
* Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to this project, please:

1. **Review the Security Checklist** (see below) before submitting code
2. **Never commit secrets** - use environment variables for sensitive data
3. **Sanitize all inputs** - use our input sanitization utilities
4. **Follow secure coding practices** - reference our secure defaults
5. **Run security audits** - use `npm audit` before committing

### For Users

When using REST-SPEC in your projects:

1. **Keep dependencies updated** - regularly run `npm update`
2. **Use HTTPS only** - never transmit sensitive data over HTTP
3. **Implement proper authentication** - use our JWT best practices
4. **Validate all inputs** - use our validation patterns
5. **Follow our secure defaults** - use the provided security configurations

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

Our security approach uses multiple layers of protection:

1. **Input Validation**

   * All user inputs are validated and sanitized
   * Schema validation using Joi
   * File type and size restrictions
   * Path traversal prevention

2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   * JWT token-based authentication
   * Role-based access control (RBAC)
   * Session management with secure cookies
   * Password hashing with bcrypt (12+ rounds)

3. **Data Protection**

   * Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
   * Encryption at rest for sensitive data
   * Database connection security (SSL required)
   * API response data filtering

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   * Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   * CORS policies properly configured
   * Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
   * Error handling without information disclosure

### Secure Dependencies

We maintain security through:

* **Automated dependency scanning** via GitHub Actions
* **Regular dependency updates** through Dependabot
* **Security audit on every commit** via pre-commit hooks
* **Version locking** to prevent unexpected updates

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls

1. **Input Sanitization**

   ```javascript
   const { sanitizeProjectName } = require("rest-spec/shared/input-sanitizer");
   const result = sanitizeProjectName(userInput);
   ```

2. **Secure Defaults**

   ```javascript
   const { getSecureDefaults } = require("rest-spec/shared/secure-defaults");
   const config = getSecureDefaults("express", "production");
   ```

3. **Authentication Helpers**

   ```javascript
   // Strong password requirements enforced
   const { password } = getSecureDefaults("auth");
   // JWT with secure algorithms only
   const { jwt } = getSecureDefaults("auth");
   ```

### Security Headers

All applications should implement these security headers:

```javascript
app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
        objectSrc: ["'none'"],
        upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
      },
    },
    hsts: {
      maxAge: 31536000,
      includeSubDomains: true,
      preload: true,
    },
  }),
);
```

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Severity

Issues that could lead to:

* Remote code execution
* SQL injection
* Authentication bypass
* Privilege escalation
* Data exfiltration

**Response Time**: 24-48 hours

### Medium Severity

Issues that could lead to:

* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
* Information disclosure
* Denial of service
* Path traversal

**Response Time**: 1 week

### Low Severity

Issues that could lead to:

* Minor information disclosure
* Rate limiting bypass
* Configuration issues
* Documentation vulnerabilities

**Response Time**: 2 weeks

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**

   * ESLint security rules
   * Dependency vulnerability scanning
   * Secret detection

2. **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**

   * Integration tests with security scenarios
   * API endpoint security validation
   * Authentication flow testing

3. **Dependency Scanning**
   * npm audit on every build
   * Dependabot automated updates
   * License compliance checking

### Manual Testing

We encourage:

1. **Code Reviews** with security focus
2. **Penetration Testing** for major releases
3. **Security Architecture Reviews** for new features

## Incident Response

### Process

1. **Detection**

   * Automated monitoring alerts
   * User reports
   * Security researcher disclosure

2. **Assessment**

   * Severity classification
   * Impact analysis
   * Affected systems identification

3. **Containment**

   * Immediate threat mitigation
   * Service isolation if necessary
   * Evidence preservation

4. **Resolution**
   * Patch development and testing
   * Coordinated disclosure
