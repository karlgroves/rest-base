# CLI Accessibility Improvements

This document summarizes the screen reader accessibility improvements made to the REST-SPEC CLI tools.

## Overview

All CLI scripts have been updated to ensure output is descriptive and screen reader friendly. Visual-only information has been replaced with text descriptions, and decorative elements have been made accessible.

## Changes Made

### 1. Status Messages

All status messages now include explicit text prefixes instead of relying on symbols:

* ✅ → "Success:"
* ❌ → "Error:"
* ⚠️ → "Warning:"
* ℹ️ → "Information:"
* 🎉 → "Success:"

### 2. Progress Indicators

* Replaced checkmarks (✓) with "Success:" prefix
* Added descriptive text to phase completion messages
* Made progress steps more verbose with clear descriptions

### 3. Visual Decorations

* Removed emoji icons from output messages
* Replaced ASCII art boxes with simple text separators
* Changed decorative separators (===) to descriptive text

### 4. Command Instructions

* Numbered steps in "Next steps" sections for clarity
* Added descriptive prefixes to commands (e.g., "Change to project directory:")
* Made all instructions explicit rather than implicit

### 5. Update Notifications

The update notification box has been converted from ASCII art to a simple text format:

```
Before:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Update available       │
└─────────────────────────┘

After:
========================================================
UPDATE AVAILABLE: REST-SPEC
========================================================
```

### 6. Logger Updates

The shared logger now uses text labels instead of symbols:

* [INFO] instead of ℹ
* [SUCCESS] instead of ✓
* [WARNING] instead of ⚠
* [ERROR] instead of ✗
* [DEBUG] instead of ●

### 7. CLI Enhancement Icons

In the dry-run and operation tracking, icons have been replaced:

* 📁 → [CREATE]
* ✏️ → [MODIFY]
* 🗑️ → [DELETE]
* → [COPY]
* ⚡ → [EXECUTE]
* 💾 → [BACKUP]

## New Accessibility Utilities

A new utility module has been created at `shared/accessibility-utils.js` that provides:

* `AccessibleProgress`: Screen reader friendly progress tracking
* `AccessibleSpinner`: Announces progress at intervals
* `formatAccessibleList`: Formats lists with item counts
* `formatAccessibleTable`: Converts tables to screen reader friendly format
* `formatStatusMessage`: Consistent status message formatting

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

When adding new CLI output:

1. Always use descriptive text instead of symbols
2. Include status prefixes (Success:, Error:, etc.)
3. Number sequential steps
4. Avoid ASCII art or decorative elements
5. Use the accessibility utilities for complex output

### For Users

To enable the most accessible experience:

1. Set environment variable `A11Y_MODE=1` or `ACCESSIBLE_MODE=1`
2. The CLI will detect common screen readers automatically
3. Progress indicators will announce at regular intervals

## Testing

To test screen reader compatibility:

1. Enable your screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, etc.)
2. Run CLI commands and verify all output is announced
3. Check that status messages are clear and descriptive
4. Ensure no information is conveyed only through visual elements

## Files Modified

The following CLI scripts have been updated:

* `scripts/create-project.js`
* `scripts/setup-standards.js`
* `scripts/update-manager.js`
* `scripts/create-project-template.js`
* `scripts/cli-enhancements.js`
* `shared/logger.js`
* `shared/update-checker.js`

## Future Improvements

1. Add audio cues for long-running operations
2. Implement verbosity levels for different user preferences
3. Add screen reader specific output modes
4. Create accessible progress bars that work with screen readers
