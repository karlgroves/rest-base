# TODO: REST-SPEC Improvements

This document contains suggested improvements after a
comprehensive code review of the REST-SPEC project,
evaluating performance, security, maintainability,
accessibility, and adherence to project standards.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

- [x] **create-project.js**: Sanitize project names before using in shell commands (lines 375-377)
- [x] **setup-standards.js**: Add input validation for npm install commands
- [x] **clean.sql**: Add safety checks to prevent accidental database destruction

### 2. Input Validation

- [x] Add project name validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- [x] Validate all user inputs before file system operations
- [x] Add checks for reserved/invalid project names

## High Priority Fixes

### 1. Error Handling

- [x] Add comprehensive error handling to all file I/O operations
- [x] Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- [x] Add proper error messages with actionable feedback
- [x] Wrap database operations in transactions (clean.sql)

### 2. Node.js Version Inconsistency

- [x] Resolve conflict between package.json (>=22.0.0) and .nvmrc (LTS version)
- [x] Update documentation to clarify version requirements

### 3. Missing Dependencies

- [x] Add ESLint as a dependency (currently creating .eslintrc.js without ESLint installed)
- [x] Add all dev dependencies mentioned in technologies.md to package.json

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Asynchronous Operations

- [x] Convert all synchronous file operations to async/await
- [x] Implement parallel execution for independent operations
- [x] Add progress indicators for long-running tasks

### 2. Resource Optimization

- [x] Batch file operations where possible
- [x] Add caching for frequently accessed configuration data
- [x] Implement streaming for large file operations

## Code Quality & Maintainability

### 1. Documentation

- [x] Add JSDoc comments to all functions in create-project.js
- [x] Add JSDoc comments to all functions in setup-standards.js
- [x] Add inline comments explaining complex logic
- [x] Create API documentation for the CLI tools

### 2. Code Organization

- [x] Extract shared ESLint configuration to a separate module
- [x] Create configuration file for customizable options
- [x] Implement proper logging using Winston (standardized choice)
- [x] Add TypeScript type definitions

### 3. Testing

- [x] Create unit tests for all script functions
- [x] Add integration tests for the complete setup process
- [x] Implement end-to-end tests for CLI commands
- [x] Add test coverage reporting

## Documentation Improvements

### 1. README.md Enhancements

- [x] Add prerequisites section with Node.js version requirements
- [x] Add badges (build status, npm version, license)
- [x] Create "Quick Start" section with code examples
- [x] Add navigation links to all documentation files
- [x] Add troubleshooting section

### 2. Resolve Documentation Conflicts

- [x] Choose between Bunyan and Winston for logging (standardized on Winston)
- [x] Consolidate validation rules (split between validation.md and request.md)
- [x] Add clear guidance on when to use Sequelize vs direct SQL

### 3. Missing Documentation

- [x] Create TypeScript standards document
- [x] Add testing standards document
- [x] Document API versioning strategy
- [x] Add deployment procedures guide
- [x] Create monitoring and alerting standards
- [x] Document caching strategies
- [x] Add CI/CD pipeline requirements

### 4. Documentation Gaps

- [x] Add rate limiting rules to global-rules.md
- [x] Include CORS policy guidelines
- [x] Add examples of JWT bearer token format
- [x] Document maximum file sizes and line counts
- [x] Add index and view naming conventions to SQL standards
- [x] Include request/response correlation ID patterns
- [x] Add file upload/download patterns
- [x] Document WebSocket/real-time communication patterns

## Feature Enhancements

### 1. CLI Improvements

- [ ] Add dry-run mode to preview changes
- [ ] Implement interactive mode for confirmations
- [ ] Add configuration file support
- [ ] Create rollback functionality
- [ ] Add support for custom templates

### 2. Development Experience

- [ ] Add auto-completion for CLI commands
- [ ] Create VS Code extension with snippets
- [ ] Add project scaffolding templates
- [ ] Implement update notifications

### 3. Safety Features

- [x] Add backup creation before applying standards
- [x] Implement confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- [ ] Add verbose logging mode
- [ ] Create undo functionality for setup-standards

## Accessibility Improvements

### 1. Documentation Accessibility

- [ ] Add table of contents to longer documentation files
- [ ] Ensure proper heading hierarchy

### 2. CLI Accessibility

- [ ] Ensure all output is screen reader friendly
- [ ] Add clear error messages without relying on color alone
- [ ] Support high contrast terminal themes
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts documentation

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Dependency Management

- [x] Add npm audit to pre-commit hooks
- [x] Implement dependency version locking
- [ ] Add security policy documentation
- [ ] Create automated dependency updates

### 2. Code Security

- [ ] Add input sanitization utilities
